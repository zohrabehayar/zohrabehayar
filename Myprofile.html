<b>A little about me</b><br>
<p>I enjoy true crime documentaries, crime tv shows and creators on YouTube who discuss different murder cases (check out Bailey Sarian on YouTube!). <br>
I am really fascinated by people who decide to kill someone or inflect pain on another human being and how their minds work. <br>
It is a morbid fascination, and I cannot really explain the fascination, but it just amazes me that there are people out there who think that murdering someone is okay!</p> <br>

<b>Interest in IT</b> <br>
<p>You know that kid that always broke the radio or anything that was technology related? Well, that was me! I have always been interested in Technology even as a child. I always wanted to know how everything worked, how it all came together and since I was a child, I have loved anything technology related.
When I started my career at my first 9-5 office job in the healthcare industry at 20 years old that is when I became interested in the operations and IT systems in a business. I worked alongside brilliant men who taught me the importance of data integrity and how important it is to maintain your system also ensuring the systems you have in place are updated!
I was a very social person, enjoyed the nightlife but then covid happened, the night life in Sydney dies so instead of sitting at home every weekend not doing anything. I started to investigate in obtaining a degree, that’s where OpenUni came in.
I have tried in the past to start a degree but was not ever that interested in the degree, this is my first degree or anything education related that I like!
I want to work towards obtaining my bachelors in IT, maybe change my career to a job that is IT based instead of operations based.</p>

<b>Chief Information Officer (CIO)</b><br>

<p>My goal in my career is to be in senior management in the healthcare industry where you can have a real impact on the morale, leadership and systems that are in place in the organisation.
The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for all the information technology in an organisation, they are also responsible for the strategy and implantation of new systems.  They oversee the infrastructure of the information technology which is used in an organisation.
I am a manager; I have management experience and I know the responsibility that you must carry when you are responsible for a team. I always tell people that the title might sound amazing, or the pay is higher, but it is not for everyone, it can be a thankless job and majority of the time you are a fixing a problem that no one else wants to fix.
Even though management can be hard, mentally crushes you sometimes or you feel like you have taken 1 step forward and the next day you have taken 10 steps back, it is also highly rewarding.
When you train, spend time with someone in your team who flourishes or the positive impact of the processes you have implemented has in the organisation that you work in; the feeling of success is euphoria.
